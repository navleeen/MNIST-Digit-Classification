# MNIST Digit Classification

This project demonstrates a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using the **MNIST dataset**. The model is trained and evaluated in a Jupyter Notebook, showcasing the workflow of preprocessing, training, and evaluating a neural network for digit recognition.

---

## Features
- Loads the **MNIST dataset** (handwritten digits).
- Preprocesses the data for training.
- Implements and trains a classification model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluates performance with accuracy metrics and visualizations.

---

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following:

```bash
python 3.x
jupyter
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
tensorflow
scikit-learn
```

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MNIST_Classification.ipynb
   ```

3. Run all cells to:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Train the model.
   - Evaluate its accuracy.
   - Visualize predictions.

---

## Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark dataset containing 70,000 images of handwritten digits.

---

## Output
- **Trained classification model** for digit recognition.
- **Accuracy score** on the test dataset.
- Visualizations of predictions (sample outputs).
